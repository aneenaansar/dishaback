                    <p>My counselling approach is based on the principles of humanistic psychology, which emphasizes the inherent worth and potential of every person. I believe that everyone has the ability to grow and change, given the right environment and support. I use various techniques such as active listening, empathy, unconditional positive regard, goal setting, problem solving, cognitive restructuring, relaxation training, mindfulness meditation, and positive affirmations to help my clients cope with their challenges and achieve their goals.</p>
                    <p class="my-4">What makes me different from other counsellors is that I treat every client as a unique individual with their own strengths and needs.

I also respect the cultural and religious backgrounds of my clients, and do not impose my own values or beliefs on them.</p>

                <p class="font-montasorrat my-6">Hello, and welcome to my counselling centre. My name is Rema Devi, and I am a counselling psychologist with a Ph.D. degree in Counselling Psychology. I have over 30 years of experience in teaching and counselling, and I am passionate about helping people achieve their personal and professional goals.</p>
                <p class="font-montasorrat my-6">I was born and brought up in a middle-class family in Kodungallur, Thrissur District of Kerala State. I graduated from St. Joseph’s College in Zoology, and did B.Ed. and M.Ed., for which guidance and counselling was an optional subject. I got married to Adv.A.S.R.Nair [who is a practicing lawyer now in the Kerala High Court], shifted to Belgaum District of Karnataka, and from there to Mumbai. During my life in Mumbai for about 20 years, I worked as a high school teacher in Maths and Science. Along with my profession, I could do a School Counsellor’s Course, M.Sc Psychology, and an International Commonwealth Diploma in ‘Youth in Development’. I won the ‘Best Teacher Award’ thrice. Due to personal reasons, I returned to Kerala and settled here in 2008. From the same week, I continued my profession as Principal in Charge and Professor in Educational Psychology in a B.Ed College for 10 years. During this period, I did M.Sc in Counselling and Family Therapy and M.Phil in Counselling Psychology. I was blessed to have an opportunity to work as an Assistant Professor for P.G classes in St.Joseph’s College Irinjalakuda for one year</p>

                </div>
                <p class="font-montasorrat my-10">I started my counselling centre at home in 2014, and since then I have been providing professional and compassionate counselling services for individuals, couples, families, and groups. I offer a range of counselling services, including pre-marital counselling, family counselling/therapy, child & adolescent counselling, school counselling, group counselling, awareness programs, motivational sessions, career guidance, teacher development programmes, and grief therapy.</p>
